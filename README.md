# Magik 8 Ball
The Magik 8 Ball is a two-part project. 
- A Python terminal program 
- A browser-based JavaScript program

Both accomplish the same purpose, telling one's fortune by answering yes and no questions. 

The browser-based version of the program was built using the logic from the Python program but with the ability to loop.
